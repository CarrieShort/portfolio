# Portfolio
Personal website to demonstrate professional skills and projects
User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
2. As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.
3. As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
